Static files are the CSS, JS, images or similar files which are sent to the client without server intervention.(not generated by the server)(hardcoded)

Static files or assets are the files that the server sends to the clients “as-it-is”, i.e., without any intervention. For example, any CSS files, background images, or JavaScript files that we might have on our website are sent to the client without modification.
